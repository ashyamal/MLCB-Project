# MLCB-project
"Using flexible docking and reinforcement learning to guide antibody design"

Improving reinforcement learning-based protein design models by incorporating 
DockGPT as an alternative reward model for superior in silico antibody design and
integrating binding energy estimates for improved accuracy in predicting antibody-antigen 
interactions
